## Introduction

This project aims to explore and analyze Roller Coaster data using statistical techniques from the book "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists." The analysis provides insights into various aspects of pizza sales, helping us understand patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/pizza-sales-dataset/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/rollercoaster-database)).Or you can find it in the `data` directory. It contains information about pizza sales, including date, location, sales figures, and other relevant variables.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The code for the EDA is available in the `code.ipynb` file. Jupyter notebooks are used for a more interactive exploration of the data.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.11.5)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
